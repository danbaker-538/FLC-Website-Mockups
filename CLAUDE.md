# FLC Website Mockups Project

## Project Overview
Creating 2-3 website design mockups for **Fun Loving Company (FLC)**, a pre-seed biotech startup, to present to the founders as different creative directions.

## About the Company

**Fun Loving Company** is developing a natural alcohol alternative called **"Misdemeanor"**.

**Founders:**
- Jonathan Lu (Stanford GSB '17)
- Ronan Levy (founder of Fieldtrip Health, psychedelic therapy company)

**Product:** Misdemeanor - a proprietary blend containing:
- Kanna (South African herb, serotonin reuptake inhibitor)
- Cacao Extract
- Licorice Root

**Key Product Facts:**
- All ingredients are FDA GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe)
- Effects last ~2 hours
- Creates relaxation, enhanced sociability, mild euphoria
- No hangover, no toxicity, no sleep disruption
- Available in capsule and 2oz shot formats (exploring gummies)
- Commercial launch planned for 2026

**The Problem They Solve:**
- Alcohol consumption at lowest since Prohibition
- Americans increasingly disconnected (57% decline in time with friends)
- Existing alternatives fall short (cannabis unpredictable, mocktails have no effect)
- Gap in market for legal, safe, prosocial substance

## Target Audience
- B2C
- Primarily 30+ individuals
- Health-conscious but still want to have fun
- People who don't drink alcohol

## Brand Guidelines

**Colors (must keep):**
- Primary Orange: #E8724A
- Cream/Off-white: #FAF7F2 / #FFF9F5
- Navy for accents: #1E293B

**Typography:** Playful serif fonts (current site uses a slab serif style)

**Tone:** Fun, playful, slightly cheeky ("This much fun should be criminal. But it's not.")

**Logo:** Hand-drawn style "Fun Loving Co." with orange underline accent
